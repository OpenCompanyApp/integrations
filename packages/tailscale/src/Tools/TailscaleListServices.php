Tailnets created before Oct 2025 can still use the legacy ID, but the Tailnet ID is the preferred identifier.

When specifying a tailnet in the API, you can:

- Provide a dash (`-`) to reference the default tailnet of the access token being used to make the API call.
  This is the best option for most users.
  Your API calls would start:

  ```sh
  curl "https://api.tailscale.com/api/v2/tailnet/-/..."
  ```

- Provide the **tailnet ID** found on the **[General Settings](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/general)**
  page of the Tailscale admin console.

  For example, if your tailnet ID name is `T1234CNTRL`, your API calls would start:

  ```sh
  curl "https://api.tailscale.com/api/v2/tailnet/T1234CNTRL/..."
  ```
